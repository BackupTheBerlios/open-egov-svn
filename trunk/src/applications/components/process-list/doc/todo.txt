The OEG::Qt::ProcessList class deletes everything on update(). It would be
better to update the fields separately because this would allow to recognize
changes and also to mark processes with an age flag.

All data ist stored in 3 lists contained in the ProcessList class. However,
the modules and threads data are related to a process. It would be better to
store such data within the ProcessInfo, but currently it is not, because
pointers to the ...Info classes are returned everywhere while working with
the data. Storing and deleting original data needs to be rewritten.

Updating is slow. Maybe a background worker thread would do it.

Updating existing entries has lower priority or is maybe unneeded.

Windows 7 is missing a lot of path names of the executables. Why?
