	* Removed a hard to find bug where item() instead of itemAt()
	  was needed. They are different but get the same parameters.
	* Killing processes fixed. Using GetExitCodeProcess() to wait for
	  process termination was a bad idea. Using EnumWindows with
	  WaitForSingleObject to close processes smart works.
