This creates a single file static application, intended to drop into c:\windows\system32 as xyz.scr.
It reads from xyz.ini, where OEG is installed, runs there the non-static built xyz.exe, gives it all
parameters and waits until finished.

TODO: some problems with the automatic build system! Builds fine as dynamic version...
