How to use the scripts and generate an multi-language MSI.

The language transform can't be created using WiX. You can create several
MSI packages (one for each language) and use another tool to compare the
packages and create the language transformation. Use the english MSI as
reference. Set the property ProductLanguage to 1033 (english). Now generate
the language transformation (a patch containing the differences) to a
german version with ProductLanguage 1031. This can be done with the
C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.0\Bin\MsiTran.exe (part of the
SDK), torch.exe (part of the new patch-building tools in WiX v3). Or use
the provided Transform.vbs.

  MsiTran.Exe -g en.msi de.msi language.de.mst
    Or
  "%WIX%bin\torch.exe" -p -t language en.msi de.msi -out de.mst

Then embed the language transformation into the base MSI (the english one).
Use the Language Id (1031 for German in this sample) as name of the sub-storage.
WiSubStg.vbs is a sample script in Windows Platform SDK and you can find it at
C:\Program Files\Microsoft Platform SDK\Samples\SysMgmt\Msi\Scripts or
C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.0\Samples\sysmgmt\msi\scripts.

  CScript.exe WiSubStg.vbs en.msi language.de.mst 1031

Update the Summary Information Stream to list all supported languages of this
package. Add a hint about the new language by changing the Summary Informations
attribute (e.g. with Orca). If your MSI authoring tool added a language code of
0 to the summary information stream remove it. First add the english language
code to the LCID, then, comma separated, the codes for every other included
language.

  Languages = 1033,1031
    Or
  WiLangId.vbs setup.msi Package 1033,1031

Check if everything works:

  msiexec /i en.msi PRODUCTLANGUAGE=1033 bzw. 1031.
  Or change the language settings with the 'Regional and Langage Options' in
  the Control Panel of Windows and then double-click the MSI to run it.
